You only need to change the content or properties that are different.","To change one instance of an object to make it different from all other instances of the same object. Because Author-it enables you to re-use objects in many places, you must duplicate the object to be able to make changes in one place independently from the original object.","What happens when I duplicate an object?","Duplicating an object creates a new copy of that object, but not copies of any objects contained in the copied object. For example, if you copy a book object, all of the objects that the copied book contains (such as embedded topics or graphics) are shared with the original book object.","Duplicating an object","To duplicate an object, you must first find the object in the folder view by using one of the following methods:","Navigate the folder view or utilize the search filters, and select the object in the folder view","If the object exists in a book, right-click the object in the book navigation and select Locate.
