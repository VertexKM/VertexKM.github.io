Since all copies share a single object ID, when you lock one of the copies in a book, all other copies are also locked in their respective books.

","Duplicating","There are several reasons that you might want to duplicate existing objects:","To create an object that is similar to an existing one, which is faster than setting up the object from scratch. You only need to change the content or properties that are different.","To change one instance of an object to make it different from all other instances of the same object. Because Author-it enables you to re-use objects in many places, you must duplicate the object to be able to make changes in one place independently from the original object.","What happens when I duplicate an object?","Duplicating an object creates a new copy of that object, but not copies of any objects contained in the copied object.
