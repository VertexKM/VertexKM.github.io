Page[6]=new Array("The Knowledge Management department is using Microsoft Teams to better facilitate communication, discussions, and file sharing in the department. ","Teams is organized into channels","A channel is a section of the site organized around a specific topic or function. For our site, we have the following channels:","General - This is the default channel that is included with all teams. The General channel is where all of the department-level communication and sharing occurs. It is essentially a log of everything that happens in the team. ","Announcements - This is a channel for important team communications. For example, this is where corporate announcements such as office closures would be shared.","Professional Organizations and Conferences - This is a channel to store files from various professional organizations and conferences, such as STC and KM World. The team OneNote includes a section for this where you can share information.","Repro Edits - This is a channel where authors let the rest of the department that a guide is ready for the final repro edit. The process is detailed in the department notebook.","Editors (QCW) Team - A channel for the editors to communicate and share files. The document library for this channel includes the standards files used by the department. For more information about document libraries, refer to Sharing files in document libraries.","Team - &lt;product&gt; - These are channels for the various product teams to use to communicate and share files with each other.","The Watercooler - A fun channel where team members can share non-work related information.","Tools and Technology - A channel to share information about the tools and technology used by the department. The Help Desk submission form is also included in this channel as is a link to view all of the help desk issues.","Team communication occurs in the Posts tab in each channel","You use the Posts tab to share questions, comments, and information with everyone else in that channel. The posts are limited to just the channel where they're submitted and only members of that channel can see and contribute to the posts. In our site, we're using the General and Announcements channels to communicate with the entire department. The product teams will use the Posts in their channels to communicate with each other. This helps with the overall communication &quot;noise&quot; and makes it easier to know what communications you need to pay attention to.","Files are shared in document libraries - Each channel has a document library that is used to share files. A document library is essentially a folder where you store the files, similar to the Windows file system. We are going to implement some new standards around the folder structures for each of the product teams so for now, don't create folders in the libraries. You can also share files in posts but that will be covered in our team training.","OneNote is installed for each channel - We're using OneNote for multiple purposes in the Teams site. There is a master team OneNote that is accessible from the General channel and includes the following sections:","Department meetings - A place to record the agenda and notes for our monthly and quarterly meetings.","Knowledge Base - We moved the wiki-based knowledge base from the current portal to OneNote. It's easier to maintain and organize in OneNote and it is still searchable.","Onboarding - This section is &quot;in progress&quot; but is intended to help with the onboarding process for future team members.","Professional Organizations and Conferences - There are sections (more can be added) for the various organizations. If you want to share information, notes from conferences or webinars, etc, this is a central place to share the information.","Standards - Currently, this section includes some quick links to the various standards documents and resources.","Training - This is another &quot;in progress&quot; section. It will include more details for various trainings that we are working on. A copy of this email is in this section. Click Teams Overview to open the note.","There is a OneNote for each product team. You can use this for team meetings, knowledge sharing, etc.","While you can open and work with OneNote in the Teams interface, it is a MUCH better experience if you work with it using the OneNote app installed on your laptop. When you open the notebook in Teams, select File &gt; Info &gt; Edit in OneNote app. This will sync the notebook with your local app and you can start working with it there.","If you are @mentioned in a post or there are posts in your channels, those are all listed in your Activity.

Page[24]=new Array("The Knowledge Management Methodology and the Knowledge Management Information Architecture are designed to be tool agnostic so they can be implemented regardless of the tool. Currently, Vertex is using the Microsoft Office Groups suite of applications. Office Groups includes the following tools:","SharePoint","Teams","Outlook","OneDrive for Business","Office Groups 365 Overview","165220.htm");
Page[25]=new Array("Microsoft Office 365 Groups is a suite of applications designed to help foster team interaction and collaboration. Included in Office Groups are Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Outlook. All of these applications are essentially different user interfaces to the underlying SharePoint architecture.","The following diagram shows how the underlying SharePoint architecture is accessed through the SharePoint site, the Teams site, OneDrive, or Outlook.","When an Office Group is created, a SharePoint site is created. The underlying architecture of this SharePoint site is the core engine for communication and file sharing for the group. The other applications in the suite, such as Teams and OneDrive, are additional views and points of entry to the underlying SharePoint architecture. ","The SharePoint site interface (the view the user has for the site) is created using the team template (not to be confused with Microsoft Teams which is another application in the Office Groups suite). This template includes applications and tools, such as Conversations and OneNote, to facilitate team communication and collaboration. The SharePoint site can be used by members of a team as well as users outside of the team. It is intended to provide a more global approach to communication and knowledge sharing.","Another application in the Office Groups suite is Microsoft Teams. This is the hub for communication and collaboration within a department or project team. It is a tool that includes team communication, file sharing, and knowledge sharing in one centralized interface. Teams is intended for use by a specific department or project team to foster communication and collaboration within that team. It has a more limited structure than SharePoint and is not meant to provide the global access that SharePoint provides.","Microsoft OneDrive for Business is the online file storage application in the Office Groups suite. All Vertex employees are provided with a OneDrive folder for their own use. The personal OneDrive folder uses a cloud icon followed by OneDrive - Vertex, Inc (@). In addition to OneDrive folders for individual use, a OneDrive for Business folder is created for each Office Group that is created. The corporate OneDrive folder uses a building icon followed by Vertex, Inc (@). Note that this is a different location than the individual employee folders. The OneDrive for Business folder that is created with the Office Group is where the document libraries for that group are housed and files in those libraries are stored. It is not recommended that you synchronize a SharePoint folder with OneDrive. Synchronizing may cause problems, such as files always opening as read-only.","The final application in the Office Groups suite is Microsoft Outlook. When an Office Group is created, the group is added to Outlook for all members. This enables communication with all group members using email.","When you plan your Office Groups strategy, it is important to understand the relationships between the different applications and how they can best work for the project. Some good questions to ask include the followings:","Who will need access to the site? Each component in the Groups suite is intended for specific audiences. Knowing who will need to access the information in the site can impact the focus of the site or the security settings. For example, SharePoint can be used by members of the team, users outside of the team, and even users outside of the company. It is intended to provide a more global approach to communication. Microsoft Teams, however, it is intended more for use by a specific team and to foster communication and collaboration within that team. Note, however, that since SharePoint is still used as the underlying architecture, you can open parts of a Team site to users outside of your team.","How will the site be used? This plays a key role in determining what applications to install with the site. For example, you can use a wiki, a discussion board, Microsoft Planner, Microsoft OneNote, surveys and forms, and more. Understanding what the users will need and how they will use the site will help you determine what to install and where. If you use both SharePoint and Teams, you have additional options for incorporating applications. For example, you can use a SharePoint Document Library to share files with users outside of the team but a Microsoft Teams wiki for sharing information within the team.","What is the purpose of the site? This will help you determine what components to use. For example, if the purpose of the site is to share knowledge with the rest of the company, then SharePoint is a better tool than Teams.","About Office Groups 365","161430.htm");

Typically, you do this by selecting a different publishing profile without making any changes to the content. However, not all outputs serve the same purpose or even audience. ","One way to meet different audience needs is to use a different topic title for each of the outputs.

The heading displays for each topic in the output and is typically written as an action that describes the function.","Publishing to Word","Help","Use this heading for traditional online help output. Like Print, Help headings are typically written as an action. This option creates legacy compiled HTML help, not the modern HTML5-based help.","Publishing to Word","Web","Use this for HTML5-based help and knowledge articles. The heading is used for the title in the help or knowledge article and is often written as a question based on what the reader might be looking to do.","How do I publish to Word?","You can accommodate these different needs in a single topic using the topic properties. When you open the properties, you can change the heading for each of the output types that Author-it supports. In the following graphic, you can see different headings for the Print and Web outputs:","Note: Consider including an Author Review Note at the beginning of the topic that lists the different headings for the topic. This makes it easier for other authors or editors to know that different headings are being used.","Complete the following to change headings for different outputs:","Open the properties for the topic.","Select the Print, Help, or Web tab and enter the heading in the Heading field.","Note: The Help tab is for legacy compiled HTML Help output.","How do I change topic headings for different outputs?","164875.htm");
