Page[49]=new Array("Author-it enables you to repeat existing objects in two unique ways: copying and duplicating. It is important to understand the use cases and impacts to content for each method.","Copying an object","When you make a copy of an object, you create a second instance of the object within the book structure or within two or more separate books. Each instance of the copy is linked to the other copies since all copies use the same unique object ID in the Author-it database. Use the copy method for situations when you want an exact duplicate of the information in another area of the same book or to within two or more books. Copying is one method that can be used to single-source content.","What happens when I copy an object?","When you copy an object, you create another instance of the object within the book or within two or more books. All properties and content are identical throughout instances of the copies. Any changes you make to one copy will be automatically reflected in all other instances of the copy. Since all copies share a single object ID, when you lock one of the copies in a book, all other copies are also locked in their respective books. The example below shows two instances of the same topic used in the same book that are locked for editing.

","Duplicating","There are several reasons that you might want to duplicate existing objects:","To create an object that is similar to an existing one, which is faster than setting up the object from scratch. You only need to change the content or properties that are different.","To change one instance of an object to make it different from all other instances of the same object. Because Author-it enables you to re-use objects in many places, you must duplicate the object to be able to make changes in one place independently from the original object.","What happens when I duplicate an object?","Duplicating an object creates a new copy of that object, but not copies of any objects contained in the copied object. For example, if you copy a book object, all of the objects that the copied book contains (such as embedded topics or graphics) are shared with the original book object.","Duplicating an object","To duplicate an object, you must first find the object in the folder view by using one of the following methods:","Navigate the folder view or utilize the search filters, and select the object in the folder view","If the object exists in a book, right-click the object in the book navigation and select Locate. The file object will be selected in the folder view behind the open book.","After the object is selected, in the folder view, click the Manage tab, within the Versioning grouping, click Duplicate the selected object (@ ).

Included in Office Groups are Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Outlook. All of these applications are essentially different user interfaces to the underlying SharePoint architecture.","The following diagram shows how the underlying SharePoint architecture is accessed through the SharePoint site, the Teams site, OneDrive, or Outlook.","When an Office Group is created, a SharePoint site is created. The underlying architecture of this SharePoint site is the core engine for communication and file sharing for the group. The other applications in the suite, such as Teams and OneDrive, are additional views and points of entry to the underlying SharePoint architecture. ","The SharePoint site interface (the view the user has for the site) is created using the team template (not to be confused with Microsoft Teams which is another application in the Office Groups suite). This template includes applications and tools, such as Conversations and OneNote, to facilitate team communication and collaboration. The SharePoint site can be used by members of a team as well as users outside of the team. It is intended to provide a more global approach to communication and knowledge sharing.","Another application in the Office Groups suite is Microsoft Teams. This is the hub for communication and collaboration within a department or project team. It is a tool that includes team communication, file sharing, and knowledge sharing in one centralized interface. Teams is intended for use by a specific department or project team to foster communication and collaboration within that team. It has a more limited structure than SharePoint and is not meant to provide the global access that SharePoint provides.","Microsoft OneDrive for Business is the online file storage application in the Office Groups suite. All Vertex employees are provided with a OneDrive folder for their own use. The personal OneDrive folder uses a cloud icon followed by OneDrive - Vertex, Inc (@). In addition to OneDrive folders for individual use, a OneDrive for Business folder is created for each Office Group that is created. The corporate OneDrive folder uses a building icon followed by Vertex, Inc (@). Note that this is a different location than the individual employee folders. The OneDrive for Business folder that is created with the Office Group is where the document libraries for that group are housed and files in those libraries are stored. It is not recommended that you synchronize a SharePoint folder with OneDrive. Synchronizing may cause problems, such as files always opening as read-only.","The final application in the Office Groups suite is Microsoft Outlook. When an Office Group is created, the group is added to Outlook for all members. This enables communication with all group members using email.","When you plan your Office Groups strategy, it is important to understand the relationships between the different applications and how they can best work for the project. Some good questions to ask include the followings:","Who will need access to the site? Each component in the Groups suite is intended for specific audiences. Knowing who will need to access the information in the site can impact the focus of the site or the security settings. For example, SharePoint can be used by members of the team, users outside of the team, and even users outside of the company. It is intended to provide a more global approach to communication. Microsoft Teams, however, it is intended more for use by a specific team and to foster communication and collaboration within that team. Note, however, that since SharePoint is still used as the underlying architecture, you can open parts of a Team site to users outside of your team.","How will the site be used? This plays a key role in determining what applications to install with the site. For example, you can use a wiki, a discussion board, Microsoft Planner, Microsoft OneNote, surveys and forms, and more. Understanding what the users will need and how they will use the site will help you determine what to install and where. If you use both SharePoint and Teams, you have additional options for incorporating applications. For example, you can use a SharePoint Document Library to share files with users outside of the team but a Microsoft Teams wiki for sharing information within the team.","What is the purpose of the site?
