   <h3>About site pages and lists</h3>
   <p class="bodytext">A SharePoint site is comprised of pages. These pages are used to display information
      in different ways. For example, you can create a page that is a list of data that
      resembles a spreadsheet. You can also create a page that is a standard web page and
      is formatted to share general information. When you create a page, you can include
      it in the left navigation or link to it from another page.</p>
