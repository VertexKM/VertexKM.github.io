   <h4>How do I view the publishing log?</h4>
   <p class="bodytext">When you publish a book, the publishing dialog box includes information about the
      different phases of the publishing process. If an error occurs during publishing,
      this information is displayed in the dialog box. When publishing is complete or is
      stopped because of an error, you can view all messages that were displayed in the
      publishing dialog box. </p>
