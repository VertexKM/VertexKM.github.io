   <h3>About site permissions and permission groups</h3>
   <p class="bodytext">Site permissions control what users can see and do on the site. Permission levels
      are groupings of permissions that give a user specific access to the site. The following
      are the standard permission levels:</p>
   <ul class="bullet">
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Full Control - The user has no restrictions on the site. This is typically reserved
            for the Owner permission group.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Design - The user can view, add, update, delete, approve, and customize content and
            site elements, such as pages.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Edit - The user can add, edit and delete lists; can view, add, update and delete list
            items and documents. This is typically used for the Member permission group.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Contribute - The user can view, add, update, and delete list items and documents.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Read - The user can view pages and list items and download documents. This is typically
            used for the Visitor permission group.</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="bodytext">A permission group is a group that includes defined site permissions. For example,
      the site owners group may have the Full Control site permissions while the site visitors
      group may only have the Read site permissions. The following are the standard permission
      groups:</p>
   <ul class="bullet">
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Owner - Site Owners have full control of the site. They can add, edit, and delete
            content as well as users and security groups. Limit the number of members in the Owner
            group to only those individuals who must have this access. Owners have the Full Control
            permission level.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Member - Site Members have full control of the content. They can add, edit, and delete
            the content. Use this group for the majority of the users. Members have the Edit permission
            level.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Visitor - Site Visitors have read-only access to the content. You can use this group
            to give access to a document library that you use to share files with other departments.
            Visitors have the Read permission level.</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="bodytext">If needed, you can assign custom permissions to specific elements of a SharePoint
      site, such as a document library. This enables you to restrict or enable access at
      a more granular level. For example, you can enable access to a document library without
      enabling access to the entire site. This is useful if you want someone in another
      department to be able to view and share files without having access to the entire
      site. Another example is to restrict access to a library. This is useful if you have
      proprietary or private files that you do not want to share with everyone who has access
      to the site.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">Note: If custom permissions are needed, it is recommended that you use them at the document
      library level and not the document level. It is much harder to maintain custom permissions
      for individual documents.</p>
