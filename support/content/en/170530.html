   <h2>Information Tracking for Tier 1 Analysts</h2>
   <p class="paragraphheading">Overview</p>
   <p class="bodytext">This process captures the objective, roles, responsibilities, and procedures that
      Tier 1 Analysts follow in capturing the customer and customer-system information needed
      to troubleshoot cases. </p>
   <p class="bodytext">Tier 1 receives most of the incoming cases from customers. Therefore, Tier 1 Product
      Application Specialists (Tier 1 Analysts) need to gather the customer and customer-system
      information necessary to troubleshoot cases. </p>
   <p class="bodytext">After Tier 1 Analysts have obtained complete information for a case, they either troubleshoot
      the case themselves or triage the case and route it to another Tier. </p>
   <p class="paragraphheading">Objective</p>
   <p class="bodytext">The objective of this process is to ensure that Tier 1 Analysts have clear guidelines
      for recording and capturing all data required to work on or triage a case.</p>
   <p class="paragraphheading">Procedures</p>
   <ol class="numberlist">
      <li class="numberlist">
         <p class="numberlist">Tier 1 Analyst determines the Case Type and Sub-type of a new case. </p>
      </li>
      <li class="numberlist">
         <p class="numberlist">Tier 1 Analyst follows the procedures and/or checklist (still being developed) for
            the specific Case Type and Sub-type in order to gather the necessary information from
            the customer.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="numberlist">
         <p class="numberlist">Throughout the lifecycle of the case, the Tier 1 Analyst ensures that all the customer
            and customer-system information needed to triage or work the case is obtained. This
            can occur during the initial contact or as a follow-up after initial contact (such
            as through a portal communication from the customer). </p>
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p class="bodytextindent">While tracking and capturing required information, Tier 1 Analysts assess the data
      they have acquired according to these three statuses and they act in accordance with
      each:  </p>
   <ol class="numberlist2">
      <li class="numberlist2">
         <p class="numberlist2">All Data Received – After Tier 1 Analysts ensure that all the required information
            from the checklist has been obtained, they either troubleshoot the case appropriate
            for Tier 1 within 24 hours (timeframe still being determined) or triage the case by
            routing it to Tier 2.  </p>
      </li>
      <li class="numberlist2">
         <p class="numberlist2">Partial Data Received – If Tier 1 Analysts determine that they have obtained some
            but not all of the required information, they communicate with the customer (by phone,
            email, or both) to obtain the remaining information needed to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p class="bodytextindent">Tier 1 Analysts who do not receive all information from the checklist should track
      the information received in the Case’s Comment section by copying and pasting the
      most recent relevant information.</p>
   <p class="bodytextindent">Example: The customer did not provide all information requested by Customer Support.
      The Tier 1 Analyst then enters the remaining information in the Salesforce Comments
      section for tracking until all information is received. For example, the Tier 1 Analyst
      adds the following information:</p>
   <p class="bodytextindent">•	About Page</p>
   <p class="bodytextindent">•	Configuration File</p>
   <p class="bodytextindent">•	Transaction Detail Report   </p>
   <ol class="numberlist2">
      <li class="numberlist2">
         <p class="numberlist2">No Data Received – If Tier 1 Analysts determine that we have received none of the
            required information (for example, a customer emailed Customer Support or sent a web
            request concerning an issue but did not provide any of the required information),
            they use Salesforce to email the customer with the checklist of the required information
            needed to troubleshoot the issue.  </p>
      </li>
   </ol>
