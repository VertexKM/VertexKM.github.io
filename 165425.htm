<h2 id="t165425" class="heading2">Introduction to the KM Department Teams Site</h2>
<p class="bodytext">The Knowledge Management department is using Microsoft Teams to better facilitate communication, discussions, and file sharing in the department. </p>
<p class="paragraphheading">Teams is organized into channels</p>
<p class="bodytext">A channel is a section of the site organized around a specific topic or function. For our site, we have the following channels:</p>
<ul class="bullet"><li class="bullet">General - This is the default channel that is included with all teams. The General channel is where all of the department-level communication and sharing occurs. It is essentially a log of everything that happens in the team. </li><li class="bullet">Announcements - This is a channel for important team communications. For example, this is where corporate announcements such as office closures would be shared.</li><li class="bullet">Professional Organizations and Conferences - This is a channel to store files from various professional organizations and conferences, such as STC and KM World. The team OneNote includes a section for this where you can share information.</li><li class="bullet">Repro Edits - This is a channel where authors let the rest of the department that a guide is ready for the final repro edit. The process is detailed in the department notebook.</li><li class="bullet">Editors (QCW) Team - A channel for the editors to communicate and share files. The document library for this channel includes the standards files used by the department. For more information about document libraries, refer to Sharing files in document libraries.</li><li class="bullet">Team - &lt;product&gt; - These are channels for the various product teams to use to communicate and share files with each other.</li><li class="bullet">The Watercooler - A fun channel where team members can share non-work related information.</li><li class="bullet">Tools and Technology - A channel to share information about the tools and technology used by the department. The Help Desk submission form is also included in this channel as is a link to view all of the help desk issues.</li></ul><p class="paragraphheading">Team communication occurs in the Posts tab in each channel</p>
<p class="bodytext">You use the Posts tab to share questions, comments, and information with everyone else in that channel. The posts are limited to just the channel where they're submitted and only members of that channel can see and contribute to the posts. In our site, we're using the General and Announcements channels to communicate with the entire department. The product teams will use the Posts in their channels to communicate with each other. This helps with the overall communication &quot;noise&quot; and makes it easier to know what communications you need to pay attention to.</p>
<ul class="bullet"><li class="bullet">Files are shared in document libraries - Each channel has a document library that is used to share files. A document library is essentially a folder where you store the files, similar to the Windows file system. We are going to implement some new standards around the folder structures for each of the product teams so for now, don't create folders in the libraries. You can also share files in posts but that will be covered in our team training.</li><li class="bullet">OneNote is installed for each channel - We're using OneNote for multiple purposes in the Teams site. There is a master team OneNote that is accessible from the General channel and includes the following sections:<ul class="bullet2"><li class="bullet2">Department meetings - A place to record the agenda and notes for our monthly and quarterly meetings.</li><li class="bullet2">Knowledge Base - We moved the wiki-based knowledge base from the current portal to OneNote. It's easier to maintain and organize in OneNote and it is still searchable.</li><li class="bullet2">Onboarding - This section is &quot;in progress&quot; but is intended to help with the onboarding process for future team members.</li><li class="bullet2">Professional Organizations and Conferences - There are sections (more can be added) for the various organizations. If you want to share information, notes from conferences or webinars, etc, this is a central place to share the information.</li><li class="bullet2">Standards - Currently, this section includes some quick links to the various standards documents and resources.</li><li class="bullet2">Training - This is another &quot;in progress&quot; section. It will include more details for various trainings that we are working on. A copy of this email is in this section. Click Teams Overview to open the note.<p class="numbertext">There is a OneNote for each product team. You can use this for team meetings, knowledge sharing, etc.</p>
<p class="numbertext">While you can open and work with OneNote in the Teams interface, it is a MUCH better experience if you work with it using the OneNote app installed on your laptop. When you open the notebook in Teams, select File &gt; Info &gt; Edit in OneNote app. This will sync the notebook with your local app and you can start working with it there.</p>
</li></ul></li></ul><p class="bodytext">If you are @mentioned in a post or there are posts in your channels, those are all listed in your Activity. This gives you a quick way to see anything you may need to address.</p>
