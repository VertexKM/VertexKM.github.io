   <h5>myVertex</h5>
   <p class="bodytext">Vertex customers access knowledge through the myVertex customer portal, which is an
      HTML5 website that uses an Oracle Service Cloud database. When customers access the
      Downloads section on myVertex, they are accessing content served from Flexera, which
      is an IT file-server solution. Flexera is the tool which stores the program files
      (and data), monthly updates, documentation, and archives for all Vertex products.
      Flexera features single-sign-on integrations with credentials that Vertex customers
      enter to log on to myVertex. On myVertex, customers can only view content related
      to Vertex products they have purchased.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">From myVertex (Oracle Service Cloud and Flexera), customers can access the following:</p>
   <ul class="bullet">
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Support knowledge articles - The knowledge support articles are created in and shared
            from Oracle Service Cloud by the customer support team. They are typically short articles
            to provide assistance with a specific issue or problem.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Product software downloads - Software downloads are provided using Flexera. </p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Product documentation - Product documentation in PDF format is also provided using
            Flexera.</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="bodytext">Posting documentation is part of the release activities for each in-market Vertex
      product. Documentation is posted when software and data are posted on the Flexera
      download pages. </p>
   <p class="bodytext">For products that have multiple authors, the team or the work leader must determine
      who will post the deliverables. There should be one primary person designated to post
      the team's documentation, with one or two other people prepared as backups. The work
      leader is responsible to ensure appropriate dialog takes place with the product teams
      regarding documentation posting to Flexera.</p>
