   <h4>External example: How can I move historical Zip9 data to my O Series 9.0 deployment?</h4>
   <p class="bodytext">All full data updates for Vertex® Indirect Tax O Series® contain historical data for TaxGIS, jurisdictional tax rules, and jurisdictional
      tax rates. The historical data is cumulative from the beginning of the Vertex O Series
      product (2003). However, the full data update contains only a single year of data
      for nine-digit ZIP Codes (Zip9). You can build historical Zip9 data over time when
      you apply updates to your previous version of O Series and upgrade to your new version
      of O Series.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">When you run the O Series upgrade utility, one of the steps displays the Zip9 Data
      Selection page with the following option: <span class="procedureinterfaceelement">Would you like to perform US ZIP9-based lookups more than one year in the past?</span> This option is <span class="emphasis">not</span> selected by default.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">Select this option to move all Zip9 records, including older and expired Zip9 data,
      to your 9.0 deployment from the source database (the previous version of O Series).
      You can then look up and process transactions that have a tax date of more than one
      year in the past and specify addresses that use nine-digit postal codes. If you do
      not need to process these types of transactions, do not select the Zip9 option.</p>
   <p class="note">note&gt;When you upgrade from a previous version of O Series, the only way to provide
      historical Zip9 data in the new version of O Series is to select the Zip9 option in
      the upgrade utility. If you do not select this option, no records are moved during
      the upgrade.</p>
