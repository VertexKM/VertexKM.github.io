   <h5>How do I use quick tables?</h5>
   <p class="bodytext">When you organize your content in your topic, a table is often the best way to display
      the information to the reader. To add a table in Author-it, you could manually draw
      out the table, format the columns and column headers, and format the rows. Another
      option is to find the folder in the Author-it library where the table objects are
      stored and drag and drop the table into your topic. Or, you could quickly select a
      pre-formatted table from a list and have it automatically added to your topic. This
      last option is probably the most efficient and uses a feature called Quick Tables.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">A quick table is simply another topic in Author-it that only contains a pre-formatted
      table. The topic is stored in a folder designated for quick tables and you can add
      as many table topics to the folder as needed. a In the Vertex Knowledge Management
      library, there are several quick table topics that cover multiple table layouts, such
      as two-column, three-column, and tables with sub-heading. </p>
   <p class="note">Note: If you are sharing your screen in an online session or presenting in a conference
      room, the Quick Tables list does not display. This is an issue with Author-it.</p>
