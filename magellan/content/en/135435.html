   <h3>Virtual Machines</h3>
   <p class="bodytext">The Knowledge Management department has two virtual machines (VMs) available to team
      members. A virtual machine is an emulated computer system that runs on a remote server.
      When you connect to a virtual machine, it is the same as if you remotely connected
      to a physical computer. You can use all of the applications installed on the virtual
      machine just as if you were using a physical computer. </p>
   <p class="bodytext">The VMs have Office 2007 installed and can be used to publish long books with numerous
      links. In subsequent versions of Office, these books take hours or days to publish.
      Another use for the VMs is to be able to use Author-it if you are using a loaner laptop.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">The Knowledge Management department currently has the following virtual machines that
      are available for Author-it publishing:</p>
   <ul class="bullet">
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">AIT6-VM01</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">AIT6-VM02</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="bodytext">You can connect to the VMs using either Microsoft Remote Desktop or&nbsp;Microsoft Remote
      Desktop Connection Manager.</p>
