   <h3>About file sharing and collaboration in Microsoft Teams</h3>
   <p class="bodytext">When you share files in Teams, you can do so using file libraries or sharing in posts.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">A file library in Teams is really a SharePoint document library and behaves like a
      file system folder in Windows. File libraries support most file types, such as Word,
      PDF, and video files. You can view and edit files using either the online or native
      version of the editing application (for example, Microsoft Word). Videos that are
      stored in the library can also be played directly from the library. For more information
      about working with files in document libraries, refer to <span class="jumptemplate_referto"><a href="#showid/161676">About document libraries</a></span>.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">To share a file in a post, you add it as an attachment to the conversation. When you
      attach a file, it can be from your computer, a network location, OneDrive, or another
      location in Teams. Files that are shared in a post can be opened in read-only mode
      or edited using the browser or local application. For example, you can open a Microsoft
      Word file in the browser or the local Word application. When you attach a file to
      a post, it is added to the Files location for that channel.</p>
