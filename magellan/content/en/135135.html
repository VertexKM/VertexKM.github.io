   <h4>Writing shorter articles</h4>
   <p class="bodytext">In general, knowledge articles should be short because their intended use is to answer
      a single question or solve a single problem. When evaluating the length, keep the
      format and user's experience in mind. Knowledge articles are HTML pages, so the more
      the user has to scroll to read the article, the greater the chance that the user will
      stop reading before finding resolution. </p>
   <p class="bodytext">Occasionally, a longer article is needed so this guide includes examples of how to
      create them.</p>
