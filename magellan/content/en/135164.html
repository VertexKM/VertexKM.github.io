   <h5>Internal example: Legacy VertexÂ® Indirect Tax Reporting &amp; Analysis (VRA) Frequently
      Asked Questions</h5>
   <p class="bodytext"><span class="emphasis">Legacy VRA</span> is VRA with IBM Cognos and requires an IBM Cognos deployment. Legacy VRA performs
      as it did when it was referred to as VRA with Cognos.</p>
   <p class="paragraphheading">How can I access Legacy VRA?</p>
   <p class="bodytext">The Legacy VRA menu option in the O Series user interface takes customers to VRA with
      Cognos. To access Legacy VRA, navigate to <span class="procedureinterfaceelement">Reporting &gt; VRA &gt; Legacy VRA</span>. This path allows users to launch the Cognos application that is connected to their
      Vertex O Series database. </p>
   <p class="note">Note: The Legacy VRA feature is available for a limited time only to users that have a Cognos
      license that they procured from Vertex. To access Legacy VRA, you must submit a request
      to Customer Support.</p>
   <p class="paragraphheading">What version of IBM Cognos is used with Legacy VRA?</p>
   <p class="bodytext">Vertex O Series 9.0 uses Cognos version 10.2.2 Fix Pack 10.</p>
   <p class="paragraphheading">Do customers who use Legacy VRA still need to create VRA user roles?</p>
   <p class="bodytext">Yes, customers who use Legacy VRA still must create VRA user roles via the VRA-specific
      roles in O Series.</p>
   <p class="paragraphheading">What are the configuration considerations for Legacy VRA customers, as each installation
      is based on a specific server?</p>
   <p class="bodytext">Customers can refer to the following documentation for Legacy VRA configuration and
      setup information:</p>

   <p class="paragraphheading">Is Vertex going to discontinue the use of Cognos?</p>
   <p class="bodytext">Vertex will discontinue Cognos at a future date that is yet to be determined. Customers
      who want to integrate Cognos with Vertex O Series 9.0 must be aware that Vertex is
      eventually moving away from using a third-party tool for reporting. In the interim,
      Cognos is still available for use with Legacy VRA in 9.0 SR1 and higher.</p>
