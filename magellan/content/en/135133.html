   <h2>Understanding knowledge article creation</h2>
   <p class="bodytext">These guidelines are intended for content that is posted to myVertex (Oracle Service
      Cloud) and to Vertex Cloud (WordPress). If additional hosting for knowledge articles
      is available at a later date, the publishing sections in this guide will be updated
      to reflect the new output capabilities. For foundational products, such as Q and L
      Series, continue to use the current writing standards.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">Goals of a knowledge article:</p>

      <li class="bullet">
