   <p class="paragraphheading">Teams is organized into channels</p>
   <p class="bodytext">A channel is a section of the site organized around a specific topic or function.
      For our site, we have the following channels:</p>

   <p class="paragraphheading">Team communication occurs in the Posts tab in each channel</p>
   <p class="bodytext">You use the Posts tab to share questions, comments, and information with everyone
      else in that channel. The posts are limited to just the channel where they're submitted
      and only members of that channel can see and contribute to the posts. In our site,
      we're using the General and Announcements channels to communicate with the entire
      department. The product teams will use the Posts in their channels to communicate
      with each other. This helps with the overall communication "noise" and makes it easier
      to know what communications you need to pay attention to.</p>

            is used to share files. A document library is essentially a folder where you store
            the files, similar to the Windows file system. We are going to implement some new
            standards around the folder structures for each of the product teams so for now, don't
            create folders in the libraries. You can also share files in posts but that will be
            covered in our team training.</p>
