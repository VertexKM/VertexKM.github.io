      Questions</h4>
   <p class="bodytext">This article contains questions and answers that you can use to help customers understand
      the changes around Vertex速 Indirect Tax Reporting &amp; Analysis (VRA).</p>
   <p class="bodytext">The <span class="emphasis">new VRA</span> is a reporting tool that uses data from Vertex速 Indirect Tax O Series速 to create standard and custom reports. Vertex is evolving this product to leverage
      the capabilities of the former Data Extract feature of Vertex O Series and to no longer
      require an IBM Cognos deployment.</p>
   <p class="bodytext"><span class="emphasis">Legacy VRA</span> is VRA with IBM Cognos and requires an IBM Cognos deployment. Legacy VRA performs
      as it did when it was referred to as VRA with Cognos.</p>
