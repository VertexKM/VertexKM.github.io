   <h4>Single-source topics between books</h4>
   <p class="bodytext">One of the ways to reuse content is to single-source a topic, either in the same book
      or in multiple books in the library. When you single-source a topic, you drag and
      drop the object from the library or another book to the location in your current book.
      When you make changes to the content in one location, the change is reflected in all
      locations.</p>
