   <p class="bodytext">In Author-it, there are styles that are used to provide feedback or pose questions
      to subject matter experts. Some of these styles are not published in the final output
      while some are.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">If needed, authors and editors can leave comments and feedback in the topic content
      using the ARN (Author Review Note) and ERN (Editor Review Note) styles. These styles
      do not publish to the final output and are intended for authors and editors to communicate
      with each other. The ARN style is indented blue text while the ERN is indented green
      text. When using these styles, preface the content with three forward slashes, your
      initials, the date, and a colon. For example, <span class="emphasis">///JLO 02042020:</span>.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">In addition to ARN and ERN, a third style, TRN (Technical Review Note), is used to
      pose a question to the subject matter experts (SMEs). This style is published in the
      Word output as it is intended to be read by the SMEs. The style publishes as red text
      with lines before and after the content.</p>
   <p class="note">Note: Avoid using review paragraph styles in embedded text and in table cells. The content
      is published as plain text by Author-it and is included in the final output.</p>
