   <h2>OneDrive</h2>
   <p class="bodytext">Microsoft OneDrive for Business is the online file storage application in the Office
      Groups suite. All Vertex employees are provided with a OneDrive folder for their own
      use. The personal OneDrive folder uses a cloud icon followed by OneDrive - Vertex,
      Inc (<img src="163072.png" class="img-responsive">). In addition to OneDrive folders for individual use, a OneDrive for Business folder
      is created for each Office Group that is created. The corporate OneDrive folder uses
      a building icon followed by Vertex, Inc (<img src="163073.png" class="img-responsive">). Note that this is a different location than the individual employee folders. The
      OneDrive for Business folder that is created with the Office Group is where the document
      libraries for that group are housed and files in those libraries are stored. It is
      not recommended that you synchronize a SharePoint folder with OneDrive. Synchronizing
      may cause problems, such as files always opening as read-only.</p>
