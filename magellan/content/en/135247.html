   <h2>Overview of writing knowledge articles</h2>
   <p class="bodytext">Welcome to the Knowledge Article Guidelines. How are you? Make sure you have a comfortable
      seat while we walk through the knowledge article creation process. It shouldn't take
      too long. Take a break if you need to. Stretch.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">We're going to take a journey that takes a different approach to writing content.
      Some writers get comfortable in their mastery of the template - the formulaic simplicity
      of a highly structured, monolithic manual. Contractions are fine. Embrace the bold.
      The sentence fragment. </p>
   <p class="bodytext">When we write knowledge articles, we write for tasks that make a connection with our
      users. There's a flexibility for the personal. It's OK if it takes some re-learning,
      and un-learning to hone our muscle memory to write in a different way.</p>
