   <h3>About users</h3>
   <p class="bodytext">Users are individuals who interact with the SharePoint site. A user's access to the
      site is determined by user groups and permissions.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">In addition to giving site access to individuals, you can also give access to groups.
      For example, you can give access to all employees. This enables anyone with a Vertex
      email address and network logon to access the site without needing to be invited.
      Using this option is recommended for sites that are intended to be used for open sharing,
      such as an intranet site. For more information about giving access to all employees,
      refer to <span class="jumptemplate_referto"><a href="#showid/135304">Adding the "Everyone except external users" user to a SharePoint group</a></span>.</p>
