   <h4>How do I view the object history?</h4>
   <p class="bodytext">When you create content, it's usually an iterative process with many changes. Sometimes
      the changes are made to follow updates and enhancements developers add to the software
      and sometimes the changes are to make the content more useful to the reader. </p>
   <p class="bodytext">During this iterative process, you may find that you want to see what the topic looked
      like before a change was made. Sometimes, you may find that after you made significant
      changes to a topic, the new structure isn't as useful to the reader and you want to
      revert back to a previous version.  </p>
   <p class="bodytext">Author-it includes a History feature that enables you to view a previous version of
      a topic, compare the changes with the current version, and, if necessary, revert to
      the previous version.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">When you view the history, you see a list of all versions of the object. You'll notice
      that some revisions have an icon. These are revisions where the content can be compared
      and, if needed, you can revert to that revision. The following graphic shows a list
      of an object's revisions:</p>
   <p class="bodytext"><img src="166074.png" class="embeddedpngfile_50_template"></p>
   <p class="bodytext">If you select a revision with an icon, you can compare the contents between the revision
      and the current version. Changes to the object are highlighted in different colors,
      depending on the type of change. The following graphic shows a comparison between
      revisions, with the old revision on the left:</p>
   <p class="figure"><img src="166073.png" class="embeddedpngfile_50_template"></p>
   <p class="note">Note: By default, the current version is selected for the comparison. You can also compare
      two past revisions.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">In addition to comparing content changes, you can also compare changes to an object's
      properties. This let's you see information like the template, the release state, and
      who created the object.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">For more information about object history, refer to the following resources:</p>
