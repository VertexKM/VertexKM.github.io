   <h3>About navigation in SharePoint</h3>
   <p class="bodytext">The navigation is to help the content consumers (users who access the content) search
      for and find what they need. The navigation is how users interact with the site. For
      most SharePoint sites, the navigation is represented by a hierarchical structure in
      the left pane of the site. The following are the different navigation options in SharePoint:</p>
   <ul class="bullet">
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Top navigation - These are links at the top of the page that open other sites.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Quick Launch (left navigation) - These are the links in the left pane of the page.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Quick Links - These are buttons or links that you can add to the home page. The links
            can open other pages in the site or external URLs.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Tree View - This shows a hierarchical folder view of the site.</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
