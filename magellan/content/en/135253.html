   <p class="paragraphheading">Reducing the noise in Teams</p>
   <p class="bodytext">With Teams acting as the central hub for department and company communication, there's
      a lot of noise that can distract you from your work. In this video series, we're going
      to look at a few ways you can make your experience with Microsoft Teams more efficient
      so you can stay focused on your work.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">Some of the ways you can improve your experience are:</p>

   <p class="paragraphheading">Opening OneNote in the local application</p>
   <p class="bodytext">OneNote is a great tool for capturing knowledge and sharing it with others. In the
      Knowledge Management Department's Teams site, each channel has its own OneNote notebook.
      </p>
   <p class="bodytext">Depending on the channel, the notebooks include information like meeting notes, knowledge
      bases, documentation and training, and general knowledge sharing.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">For the best experience, we recommend opening the notebook using your local OneNote
      application. This lets you use all of the application's features and makes it easier
      to work with the notebook.</p>
