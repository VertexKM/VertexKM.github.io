   <h3>About team members</h3>
   <p class="bodytext">Microsoft Teams is a membership-based tool. This means that you must be a member to
      participate in a Team. The following memberships are available:</p>
   <ul class="bullet">
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Owner - A team owner can configure various settings for the team, such as managing
            members, team settings, and analyzing site analytics.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Member - Members are the participants in the team who have access to the various features.
            Team members participate in group communications, upload and edit files, and share
            knowledge.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">Guest - A guest is anyone outside of the organization who has access to the team.
            The team owner configures the level of access guests have to the site and site content.</p>
         <p class="note">Note: Additional access and permissions can be configured in SharePoint. For example, you
            can create a separate document library for sharing files with other departments without
            giving those departments access to the rest of the document libraries in the team
            site.</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="paragraphheading">Leave a team</p>
   <p class="bodytext">Complete the following to leave a team:</p>
   <ol class="numberlist">
      <li class="numberlist">
         <p class="numberlist">Click the ellipsis next to the team.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="numberlist">
         <p class="numberlist">Select <span class="procedureinterfaceelement">Leave the team</span>.</p>
