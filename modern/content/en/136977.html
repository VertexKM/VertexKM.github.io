   <h4>Commodity codes in O Series</h4>
   <p class="bodytext">Commodity codes belong to standard classification systems and can be used by companies
      to classify products and services for various purposes. Your Vertex product supports commodity code classification systems that are used in various countries
      around the world. These systems are:</p>
   <ul class="bullet">
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet"><span class="jumptemplate_textstring">UNSPSC codes</span> from the United Nations Standard Products and Services Code<span class="superscript">Â®</span> taxonomy</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet"><span class="jumptemplate_textstring">NCM codes</span> from the Brazilian Mercosul Common Nomenclature </p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet"><span class="jumptemplate_textstring">Service codes</span> from Brazilian federal legislation for the ISS tax</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet"><span class="jumptemplate_textstring">HSN codes</span> from the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="paragraphheading">Vertex support for commodity codes</p>
   <p class="bodytext">Vertex Tax Research maintains commodity codes that correspond to <span class="emphasis">existing</span> Vertex-defined taxability categories. These commodity codes are included in the O
      Series monthly data updates. You can use the Commodity Codes feature to search for
      commodity codes that are supported in Vertex data and then view the taxability of
      those codes.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">For example, here is a search for UNSPSC code 25101511, which is mapped to the O Series
      taxability category for Hybrid Vehicles:<br></p>
   <p class="figurewide"><img src="136375.png" class="embeddedpngfile_60_template"></p>
   <p class="spacer"></p>
   <p class="bodytext">When you have a good or service for which the commodity code is not defined in the
      O Series data updates, you have the following options:</p>
   <ul class="bullet">
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">You can <span class="jumptemplate_textstring">add a commodity code</span> in O Series and map it to an existing taxability category.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet">You can file a service request with your Vertex Customer Support representative to
            add support for that code. Vertex reviews the request and determines if data is available
            to support the code.</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="paragraphheading">What you can do with commodity codes in O Series</p>
   <p class="bodytext">When Vertex-supplied taxability data includes the commodity codes that apply to your
      products and services, you can pass transactions and the associated commodity codes
      from your financial system directly to O Series for tax determination. You do not
      need to set up taxability drivers and then map the drivers to taxability categories.
      </p>
   <p class="bodytext">The O Series user interface provides tools for working with commodity codes so you
      can:</p>
   <ul class="bullet">
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet"><span class="jumptemplate_textstring">Review the taxability of a commodity code</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet"><span class="jumptemplate_textstring">Add custom commodity codes</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
         <p class="bullet"><span class="jumptemplate_textstring">Identify the commodity code used in a transaction</span>.</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
