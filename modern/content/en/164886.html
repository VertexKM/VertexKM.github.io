   <h4>About Vimeo</h4>
   <p class="bodytext">The Knowledge Management department uses Vimeo to host videos created by team members.
      The service enables us to include links to videos in content we create, such as product
      documentation and tools training. When videos are uploaded, they are only accessible
      to people who have the direct link to open them. The videos are not publicly available.</p>
   <p class="bodytext">When a video is ready to be uploaded to Vimeo, contact the Knowledge Management department
      administrators (currently Mike Andrews and Jim Osborn). They will upload the video
      and send you the direct link to include in the content or post.</p>
   <p class="note">Note: It may take several minutes to several hours for the video to finish processing after
      it is uploaded to Vimeo. The administrators will notify you when the video is ready
      to be shared.</p>
